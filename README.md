## 🧠Overview  
Air Canvas is a creative and intuitive application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical tools. By harnessing the power of computer vision, the project showcases how technology can transform traditional art creation into a touch-free and interactive experience.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🖐️**Gesture Recognition:** Detects and interprets hand movements in real-time to enable seamless drawing.  
- 🖌️**Virtual Canvas:** Offers an on-screen canvas where users can unleash their creativity.  
- 🎨**Color Selection:** Includes customizable options for brush colors and thickness.  
- 🧽**Erasing Functionality:** Allows users to modify or clear their drawings effortlessly.  
- ⚡**Real-Time Performance:** Implements efficient algorithms for smooth and lag-free drawing.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack   
- **Languages/Tools:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe  
- **Hardware Requirements:** Camera-enabled device  

## 🔍 How It Works    
1. **Hand Detection:** Utilizes computer vision to recognize hand gestures through the camera feed.  
2. **Tracking:** Tracks hand movement and maps it to corresponding positions on the virtual canvas.  
3. **Drawing Mechanism:** Converts gestures into actions, such as drawing lines, selecting colors, or erasing.  

## 🚀 Installation 
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Air-Canvas.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy  
  
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python mainpaint.py  
   ```  

## 🎮 Usage  
- Ensure your camera is enabled.  
- Use gestures (as defined in handTracker.py) to draw or perform actions.
- Use predefined gestures to change colors, adjust brush size, or erase.  

## 💡 Applications  
- Promotes touch-free interaction, ideal for creative work or accessibility solutions.  
- Demonstrates potential use cases for computer vision and gesture recognition.
